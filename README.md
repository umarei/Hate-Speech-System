# Hate Speech Detection System

![Hate Speech Detection System](An_illustration_showing_a_Hate_Speech_Detection_Sy.png)

## Overview
This project is a Hate Speech Detection System designed to identify and categorize hate speech within text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Leveraging machine learning models, this system can detect and flag offensive or hateful language, making it valuable for social media moderation, forums, or any text-based platform requiring content monitoring.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleanses text data by removing noise (e.g., special characters, punctuation) and tokenizes it for better model input.
- **Word Embeddings**: Utilizes word embedding techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe to convert text into vector representations.
- **Classification Model**: Implements advanced algorithms (LSTM, BERT, or CNN) to classify text as hate speech or non-hate speech.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Supports integration with real-time data sources for on-the-fly hate speech detection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NLP Libraries: `spaCy`, `NLTK`
- Flask for API Deployment
- SQL/NoSQL database for storing flagged content

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hate-speech-detection-system.git
   ```
     ```bash
   cd hate-speech-detection-system
## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Prepare Data

- Collect a labeled dataset containing samples of hate speech and neutral text (e.g., Twitter or Reddit datasets).
- Preprocess data by removing stopwords, tokenizing, and converting text to lowercase.
## Train the Model

Use the provided script to train the model on the preprocessed dataset:

```bash
python train_model.py
```
## Run the System
Start the Flask API server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Access the endpoint at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to test hate speech detection.


## API Endpoints

### `POST /detect` - Analyze a text sample for hate speech.

#### Request:

```json
{
  "text": "Enter text to analyze"
}
```


#### Response:

```json
{
  "prediction": "hate_speech",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

## Usage

- **Detect Hate Speech**: Send text input to the `/detect` endpoint to check if it contains hate speech.

- **View Results**: The response will contain a label (`hate_speech` or `neutral`) and the modelâ€™s confidence score.


## Evaluation

The model evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are calculated on a validation set to provide insights into its performance.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Model Architecture**: Consider implementing BERT-based transformers for enhanced accuracy.
- **Language Support**: Expand to detect hate speech in multiple languages.
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Integrate with Kafka for live data analysis.
